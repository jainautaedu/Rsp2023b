This is a set of MATLAB files needed to compute thermal spreading resistance from an isothermal source into a finite-thickness cylindrical body. 
This supplements the work presented in Jain, A., 'Thermal spreading resistance from an isothermal source into a finite-thickness body,' **to be updated after publication **

Parameters tbar and Bisink are to be specified in main.m. Executing this file returns the curve fit coefficients as defined in section 5.7 of the paper.
